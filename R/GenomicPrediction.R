#' @title R interface for TASSEL's genomic prediction capabilities
#'
#' @description This function acts as a front-end for TASSEL's genomic
#'   prediction functions. This analysis method uses gBLUP (genomic BLUP) to
#'   predict phenotypes from genotypes. It proceeds by fitting a mixed model
#'   that uses kinship to capture covariance between taxa. The mixed model can
#'   calculate BLUPs for taxa that do not have phenotypes based on the
#'   phenotypes of lines with relationship information.
#'
#'   A phenotype dataset and a kinship matrix must be supplied as input to the
#'   method by selecting both then choosing Analysis/Genomic Selection. In
#'   addition to trait values, the phenotype dataset may also contain factors
#'   or covariates which will be used as fixed effects in the model. All taxa
#'   in the phenotype dataset can only appear once. No repeated values are
#'   allowed for a single taxon. When the analysis is run, the user is
#'   presented with the choice to run k-fold cross-validation. If cross-
#'   validation is selected, then the number of folds and the number of
#'   iterations can be entered. For each iteration and each fold within an
#'   iteration, the correlation between the observed and predicted values will
#'   be reported. If cross-validation is not selected, then the original
#'   observations, predicted values and PEVs (prediction error variance) will
#'   be reported for all taxa in the dataset.
#'
#'   When k-fold cross-validation is performed, only taxa with phenotypes and
#'   rows in the kinship matrix are used. That set of taxa are divided into k
#'   subsets of equal size. Each subset in turn is used as the validation set.
#'   Phenotypes of the individuals in the validation are set to 0 then
#'   predicted using the remaining individuals as the training set. The
#'   correlation (r) of the observed values and predicted values is calculated
#'   for the validation set and reported. The mean and standard deviation of
#'   the mean of the r's are calculated for each trait and reported in the
#'   comments section of the "Accuracy" data set that is output by the
#'   analysis. In general, the results are not very sensitive to the choice of
#'   k. The number of iterations affects the standard error of the mean for the
#'   accuracy estimates. The defaults of k = 5 and iterations = 20 will be
#'   adequate for most users.
