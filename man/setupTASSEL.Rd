\title{Download and configure TASSEL JAR files from Maven Central}
\usage{
setupTASSEL(version = TASSEL_MAVEN$VERSION, force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{version}{TASSEL version to download. Defaults to \code{"5.2.96"}.}

\item{force}{If \code{TRUE}, re-download even if a cached version exists.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
The path to the JAR cache directory (invisibly).
}
\description{
Downloads the TASSEL fat JAR (with all dependencies) from Maven
Central and caches it locally. This only needs to be run once per
TASSEL version. Subsequent package loads will use the cached JAR
automatically.
}
\details{
The JAR is downloaded from Maven Central at:
\url{https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.maizegenetics/tassel}

Files are cached under the standard R user cache directory
(see \code{\link[tools]{R_user_dir}}) at
\code{~/.cache/R/rTASSEL/java/<version>/} (Linux),
\code{~/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/rTASSEL/java/<version>/} (macOS),
or the equivalent on Windows.

A SHA-1 checksum is verified after download to ensure file integrity.
