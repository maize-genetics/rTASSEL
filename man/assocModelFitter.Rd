\arguments{
\item{tasObj}{An object of class \code{TasselGenotypePenotype}.}

\item{formula}{An R-based linear model formula. The general layout of this
formula uses the following TASSEL data scheme:
\code{<data> ~ <factor> and/or <covariate>}. If all traits in a Phenotype
object should be ran, a simplified formula (\code{. ~ .}) can be used.
This scheme can also be used for running all \code{<data>} or
\code{<factor>} and/or \code{<covariate>} data as well. Single variables
are separated witha \code{+} operator. See vignette for further
clarification.}

\item{fitMarkers}{Should marker data be fitted? If \code{TRUE}, GLM
analysis will be executed. If \code{FALSE}, BLUEs will be calculated.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{kinship}{Should kinship data be accounted for in the model? If so,
a TASSEL kinship matrix object of class \code{TasselDistanceMatrix} must
be submitted. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{fastAssociation}{Should TASSEL's Fast Association plugin be used?
Consider setting to \code{TRUE} if you have many phenotypes in your
data set.}

\item{maxP}{Maximum p-value (0 - 1) to be reported. Currently works with
fast association only. Defaults to a p-value of \code{0.001}
will be used as a threshold. \strong{Note:} p-value parameter will
not be used for BLUE analysis.}

\item{maxThreads}{Maximum threads to be used when running fast association.
If \code{NULL}, all threads on machine will be used.}

\item{minClassSize}{The minimum acceptable genotype class size. Genotypes
in a class with a smaller size will be set to missing. Defaults to 0.}

\item{outputFile}{Output file prefix to be specified in case you want
to write data directly to disk. Highly recommended for large datasets.
If \code{NULL}, no data will be saved to disk. If a character}

\item{biallelicOnly}{Only test sites that are bi-allelic. The alternative is
to test sites with two or more alleles. Defaults to \code{FALSE}}

\item{appendAddDom}{If true, additive and dominance effect estimates will
be added to the stats report for bi-allelic sites only. The effect will
only be estimated when the data source is genotype (not a probability).
The additive effect will always be non-negative. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\description{
This function acts as a front-end for TASSEL's extensive
   association analysis methods. Using this function, users can run
   the following TASSEL association methods:
   \itemize{
     \item{best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs)}
     \item{generalized linear model (GLM)}
     \item{mixed linear model}
     \item{Fast association (Shabalin 2012)}
   }
